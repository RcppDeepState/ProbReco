#ProbRecoPackage

A package for probabilistic forecast reconciliation based on score optimisation.

Objective is to do optimisation via stochastic gradient methods.

Currently just playing around (for a week) working out how to integrate the STAN math c++ headers with RCpp eigen and an R package.  This allows the gradients to be worked out by automatic differentiation.
